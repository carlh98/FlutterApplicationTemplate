# HTTP

We use [Dio](https://pub.dev/packages/dio) for any HTTP related work.

For more documentation on HTTP requests, read the references listed at the bottom.

## HTTP clients

- We use `Interceptor` to create HTTP request / response pipelines. There are lot of interceptors implementation in the community.

- We use [Retrofit](https://pub.dev/packages/retrofit) to generate the HTTP implementations in the data access layer.
