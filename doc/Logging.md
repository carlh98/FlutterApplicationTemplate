# Logging

We use [TODO]() for logging.

For more documentation on logging, read the references listed at the bottom.

## Log levels

We use the following convention for log levels:

  - **Trace** : Used for parts of a method to capture a flow.
  - **Debug** : Used for diagnostics information.
  - **Information** : Used for general successful information. Generally the default minimum.
  - **Warning** : Used for anything that can potentially cause application oddities. Automatically recoverable.
  - **Error** : Used for anything that is fatal to the current operation but not to the whole process. Potentially recoverable.
  - **Critical** : Used for anything that is forcing a shutdown to prevent data loss or corruption. Not recoverable.
